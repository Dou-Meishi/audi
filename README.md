# A Simple Python Implementation of Automatic Differentiation

This repository contains the implementation of automatic differentiation discussed in [my post](https://dou-meishi.github.io/org-blog/2024-09-24-ImplementBP/notes.html).

The overall framework is based on [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VpeE6UvEPRz9HmsHh1KS0XxXjYu533EC).
